## Changelog

### Unreleased

No unreleased changes.

### v9.9.0 - Simulation-complete controlled evolution candidate (2026-04-27)

Simulation-complete release candidate for controlled skill evolution. This version makes self-improvement reviewable and parser-guarded while keeping simulated evidence explicitly non-validating.

**Added**: controlled evolution workflow surfaces with `/seo:evolve-skill` and `/seo:run-evals`; 16 simulated eval cases across `geo-content-optimizer`, `content-quality-auditor`, `memory-management`, and failure-probe scenarios; accepted, rejected, and superseded EvolutionEvent samples; PR-grade mock evidence in `references/evolution-pr-grade-mock.md`; failure probes in `references/evolution-failure-probes.md`; PR-template evolution metadata; `references/evolution-protocol.md`; `references/evolution-optimization-plan.md`; `references/evolution-evidence-review.md`; and `memory/evolution/` for controlled skill improvement records.

**Changed**: retired the temporary `/seo:p2-review` command and replaced its maintenance slot with the eval execution entrypoint. All public manifests and skill versions are aligned to 9.9.0.

**Guarded**: `/seo:evolve-skill` is proposal-only with no edit permission; simulated and external-research-only evidence cannot be accepted; accepted events require approval, `validation_results.status: passed`, `validation_results.acceptance_eligible: true`, validation evidence, project-local provenance, risk, and rollback; validation and contract-lint command docs include controlled evolution checks; parser-grade slimming guardrails protect command inventory, EvolutionEvent schema, PR-grade mock evidence, failure probes, retired command references, and evolution surfaces.

**Protected**: all 20 skills and 16 commands remain. The 9.9.0 evolution layer is simulation-complete but still requires project-local evidence and human approval before an event can become accepted.

### v9.5.0 - Consolidated post-v9.0.0 release (2026-04-26)

Single public release consolidating all work after v9.0.0.

**Changed**: fixed `/seo:geo-drift-check` prompt-injection false positive; replaced the Windows-incompatible marketplace symlink with a real mirror; added `allowed-tools` to `/seo:contract-lint` from PR #10; compressed regular skill shells, commands, root docs, and high-volume reference packs; added `scripts/validate-slimming-guardrails.sh`; strengthened `validate-skill.sh` for shared-section checks and auditor runbook hash validation; updated release workflow checks; aligned cross-agent manifests, marketplace files, badges, `CITATION.cff`, and all skill versions; replaced interactive Stop hooks with an allow-only JSON Stop guard.

**Protected**: all 20 skills and 15 commands remain. Discovery aliases, CORE-EEAT, CITE, auditor runbook semantics, memory/entity contracts, schema placeholders, technical audit fields, reporting benchmarks, freshness rules, CTA logic, intent mapping, anchor thresholds, KPI formulas, WCAG checks, rich-result policy checks, and backlink disavow safeguards are preserved.

**Credit**: PR #10 from @xiaolai identified the missing `/seo:contract-lint` `allowed-tools` declaration.

### v9.0.0 - Quality pass + multi-agent compatibility (2026-04-17)

Combined a 6-agent quality review, legal/compliance hardening, directly executable playbooks, and native install support for Gemini CLI, Qwen Code, Amp, Kimi Code CLI, and CodeBuddy. No breaking changes to skill I/O contracts.

Highlights:

- Added `SECURITY.md`, FTC disclosure checks, GDPR retention/deletion flow, EU AI Act TDM notes, WCAG 2.2 AA alt-text ordering, schema truth warnings, and trademark annotations.
- Added playbooks for AI Overview recovery, bulk audits, ecommerce platform issues, LLM crawler handling, migrations, entity/GEO handoff, and GEO score feedback loops.
- Added `/seo:geo-drift-check`.
- Trimmed 11 large `SKILL.md` files and moved execution detail to compact `references/instructions-detail.md` files.
- Added Handoff Summary coverage for all skills.
- Expanded memory scaffolding and terminology.
- Hardened auditor cap arithmetic, runbook hash alignment, Next Best Skill termination, wiki ownership, and HOT cache identity.
- Split commands into 10 user commands and 5 maintenance commands.
- Removed all Python scripts; maintenance utilities are markdown slash commands plus the retained Bash validator.
