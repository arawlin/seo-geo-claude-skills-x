# SEO & GEO Skills Library — Versions

Current versions of all skills. Agents can fetch this file from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/main/VERSIONS.md` once per session to check for updates.

**Versioning**: Skill versions (`metadata.version` in SKILL.md) track skill content changes independently. Plugin version (in `plugin.json`) tracks manifest and infrastructure changes.

## Changelog

### v7.0.0 — Wiki Knowledge Layer + Infrastructure Upgrades (2026-04-06)

Major release: wiki compilation layer for cross-skill knowledge synthesis, plus infrastructure and community upgrades accumulated since v6.0.0. Inspired by [Karpathy's LLM Wiki pattern](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f).

**Wiki Knowledge Layer** ([full spec](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/references/proposal-wiki-layer-v3.md)):
- **Structured index**: `memory/wiki/index.md` — auto-refreshed compiled index of all WARM files with precise fields (score, 健康度, status, next_action, mtime) and best-effort summaries
- **Project isolation**: `memory/wiki/<project>/index.md` partitioned by hot-cache `project` field; single-project users unaffected
- **Auto-refresh**: PostToolUse silently updates index after WARM writes; first init requires manual trigger (`refresh wiki index`)
- **User-tier guidance**: SessionStart provides natural-language next-step guidance for light users; structured dashboards for power users
- **Compiled pages** (Phase 2): entity/keyword/topic pages with SHA-256 source hash tracking and confidence-labeled contradiction reconciliation (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- **`/seo:wiki-lint` command** (10th command): 7-check health scan — contradictions, orphan pages, stale claims, missing pages, cross-references, HOT drift, hash mismatches
- **WARM retirement dry-run** (Phase 3): `wiki-lint --retire-preview` lists candidates; actual archival requires user confirmation
- **Terminal architecture**: HOT/WIKI/COLD three-layer target via gradual WARM absorption
- **Safe rollback**: `rm -rf memory/wiki/` reverts to pre-wiki behavior with zero side effects
- **Response Presentation Norms**: conclusion-first, natural language, collapsible technical detail, no internal jargon in user-facing output
- **Optional Wiki Hints**: handoff summary fields (Wiki Entities, Wiki Keywords) for cross-skill metadata

**Infrastructure (from v6.1.0–v6.2.0)**:
- `when_to_use` and `argument-hint` frontmatter fields added to all 20 skills
- Hooks hardening: SessionStart matcher narrowed; Stop split into focused prompts; FileChanged monitors hot-cache overflow; UserPromptSubmit connector tier awareness
- Memory system: dual truncation rule (80 lines + 25KB), staleness protocol, frontmatter standard
- Community governance: SECURITY.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, CITATION.cff, PRIVACY.md, .github/FUNDING.yml, issue templates
- README redesign: hero tagline, badges, 6-language switcher, collapsible skill finder
- 5 localized READMEs: Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Portuguese
