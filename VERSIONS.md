# SEO & GEO Skills Library — Versions

Current versions of all skills. Agents can fetch this file from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/main/VERSIONS.md` once per session to check for updates.

**Versioning**: Skill versions (`metadata.version` in SKILL.md) track skill content changes independently. Plugin version (in `plugin.json`) tracks manifest and infrastructure changes.

## Changelog

### v4.0.0 (2026-03-24)

ClawHub-first marketplace optimization: security fixes, vector search descriptions, multi-ecosystem install documentation.

**Security & metadata fixes**:
- Removed self-contradictory `metadata.openclaw` blocks from 9 skills (soft dependencies incorrectly declared as hard requirements)
- Fixed copy-paste error: alert-manager and performance-reporter had `primaryEnv: AMPLITUDE_API_KEY` (unrelated to their function)
- Added credential-optional statements to 11 skills with external tool integrations
- Added `homepage` field to all 20 SKILL.md frontmatters

**ClawHub search optimization**:
- Rewrote all 20 skill descriptions with natural language summaries prepended for vector search discovery
- Streamlined trigger phrases to 6-8 highest-frequency per skill
- Updated footer links to include GitHub, ClawHub, and skills.sh

**Documentation migration**:
- README: Replaced single-recommendation install with tool-based routing table (OpenClaw / Claude Code / Cursor+Codex+Windsurf)
- AGENTS.md: ClawHub moved to first position in ecosystem table; install section uses routing table
- CONTRIBUTING.md: Fixed template missing ClawHub and Vercel Labs in compatibility field; added `clawhub publish` / `clawhub sync` commands
- CLAUDE.md: Added ClawHub and skills.sh marketplace links
- config.yml: Added ClawHub Marketplace as issue template contact link

**Infrastructure**:
- plugin.json: homepage changed from skills.sh to GitHub repo URL (neutral)
- marketplace.json: version synced to 4.0.0
- validate-skill.sh: Updated openclaw check from WARN-if-missing to PASS-if-missing (pure instruction skills don't need runtime declarations)
