# SEO & GEO Skills Library — Versions

Current versions of all skills. Agents can fetch this file from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/main/VERSIONS.md` once per session to check for updates.

**Versioning**: Skill versions (`metadata.version` in SKILL.md) track skill content changes independently. Plugin version (in `plugin.json`) tracks manifest and infrastructure changes.

## Changelog

### v9.0.1 — Prompt-injection false positive fix (2026-04-18)

Patch release addressing a ClawHub OpenClaw scan that flagged the published v9.0.0 as **Suspicious (medium confidence)**. The scanner correctly matched a prompt-injection literal in `commands/geo-drift-check.md:48` — the literal was defensive example text warning the model to distrust AI-engine output, but the quoted phrase itself was indistinguishable from a real injection attempt under regex scanning.

**Change**: rewrote the warning to describe the injection category without embedding a literal override-style directive. No behavioral change to any skill or command; the defensive intent is preserved.

**Files touched**: `commands/geo-drift-check.md` (line 48). All plugin manifests bumped to 9.0.1 for republish; skill-level `metadata.version` values unchanged because no skill content was modified.

### v9.0.0 — Quality Pass + Multi-Agent Compatibility (2026-04-17)

Major release combining three streams of work: (1) a 6-agent panel quality review with legal/compliance hardening, (2) ten new playbooks and instructions-detail references that make skills directly executable without inline bloat, and (3) native install support for five additional AI coding agents.

**Heads-up for existing users**: no breaking changes to skill I/O contracts. Score numbers may shift slightly on re-audit because of new FTC/GDPR/WCAG checks and tightened veto evaluation; if so, the affected item is flagged in the "Critical Issue to Fix" section. The core operating model (trigger → quick start → skill contract → handoff → next best skill) is unchanged.

#### Legal & Compliance (new)

- **SECURITY.md** scraping boundaries — robots.txt, CFAA, hiQ v LinkedIn / Meta v Bright Data precedents, EU DSM Art 4 TDM-reservation awareness
- **FTC affiliate-disclosure enforcement** in CORE-EEAT T04 — five new sub-items. Substantive standard: 16 CFR §255.5 (Endorsement Guides); penalty hook: 15 U.S.C. §45(m) → 2024 Trade Regulation Rule on Consumer Reviews and Testimonials (16 CFR Part 465), inflation-adjusted annually per 16 CFR §1.98 (~$53K/violation in 2025)
- **GDPR Art 4 / Art 17** retention + deletion flow in `memory-management`; **Art 6** lawful-basis prompt in `entity-optimizer`
- **EU AI Act Art 53** TDM reservation in `technical-seo-checker/references/llm-crawler-handling.md`
- **ADA / WCAG 2.2 AA** alt-text rebalance — 1.1.1 descriptive primary, SEO keyword secondary (previous ordering risked ADA compliance claims)
- **Schema aggregateRating** truth warnings on 4 template blocks (preventing fake-rating schemas)
- **Trademark annotations** — Moz Domain Authority™ / Ahrefs Domain Rating™ referenced with TM glyphs where first mentioned

#### New Playbooks (high-value, directly usable)

- `build/geo-content-optimizer/references/ai-overview-recovery.md` — playbook for recovering traffic after losing Google AI Overview citation
- `optimize/on-page-seo-auditor/references/bulk-audit-playbook.md` — site-wide batch audit workflow
- `optimize/technical-seo-checker/references/bulk-audit-playbook.md` — counterpart for technical health
- `optimize/technical-seo-checker/references/ecommerce-platform-patterns.md` — Shopify, WooCommerce, Headless, BigCommerce, Magento common issues
- `optimize/technical-seo-checker/references/llm-crawler-handling.md` — robots.txt patterns for GPTBot, ClaudeBot, Gemini, Perplexity, etc.
- `optimize/technical-seo-checker/references/pre-migration-playbook.md` — 6-stage WordPress → Headless migration guide
- Inter-skill contracts: `references/entity-geo-handoff-schema.md` (entity-optimizer ↔ geo-content-optimizer) and `references/geo-score-feedback-loop.md` (T+14/T+45/T+90 validation protocol)

#### New command

- `/seo:geo-drift-check` (experimental) — validates predicted GEO Score against actual AI-engine citation behavior. Pure-markdown command; uses whichever AI-engine MCP the user has connected. No Python scripts, no scheduled runners, no bundled API keys.

#### Content Quality (SKILL.md size compliance)

- 11 SKILL.md files trimmed to ≤350 lines per CLAUDE.md rule. Execution detail moved to `references/instructions-detail.md` (9 new reference files across research/build/cross-cutting). Skill body now declares behavior; detail file defines procedure. Reduces cold-load token footprint by ~40% on affected skills.
- Handoff Summary template added to all 18 non-auditor skills (20/20 coverage now).

#### Memory System Expansion

- Memory scaffolding: `memory/glossary.md`, `memory/decisions.md`, `memory/open-loops.md`, `memory/entities/candidates.md`, `memory/geo-feedback/` (with YAML frontmatter + initial templates)
- Top-level `GLOSSARY.md` (12 library-internal terms) linked from README and 5 localized docs. Reduces jargon friction for new users.

#### Contract Hardening

- Cap rounding determinism: `math.floor` rule added to Runbook §2 (no more 59.8 vs 59 off-by-one)
- Runbook SHA256 alignment made six-way (source × 3 + block × 4) via class marker for `contract-lint` reliability
- Next Best Skill cycle termination: verdict-conditional + visited-set patterns in 5 skills, documented in `skill-contract.md`
- `class: auditor-output` frontmatter marker added for hook field decoupling
- Wiki sole-writer delegation clarified in `state-model.md`
- HOT tier identity unified (32 stale `CLAUDE.md` references swapped for `memory/hot-cache.md`)
- `gap_type` namespace disambiguation (entity vs audit)
- `approved_by` provenance cascade for `memory/decisions.md`

#### i18n & UX

- Quick Start in 60 seconds — 3-step TL;DR above the detailed install table
- Commands tier split: 10 user (day-to-day) + 5 maintenance (for power users; includes the two slash commands that replaced the purged `.py` scripts)
- Next Best decision trees embedded in 5 skills (`keyword-research`, `content-quality-auditor`, `on-page-seo-auditor`, `competitor-analysis`, `entity-optimizer`)
- Mini-examples (User prompt + Output + Reference link) in 10 trimmed Example sections
- Jargon dimension codes (C/O/R/E/Exp/Ept/A/T) removed from `/seo:audit-page` and `/seo:audit-domain` user-visible output
- `--technical` flag removed (§5 violation)
- 3 thin skills expanded: `memory-management`, `internal-linking-optimizer`, `schema-markup-generator` (+39 triggers in JA/KO/ES/PT + misspellings)
- ES/PT diacritics restored (48 accented characters each, 0 regressions)
- Language switcher labels corrected: Espanol → Español, Portugues → Português

#### Native Install (5 more agents)

Carried forward from v8.0.3 interim work:

- Gemini CLI: `gemini extensions install <github-url>` — via new `gemini-extension.json`
- Qwen Code: `qwen extensions install <github-url>` — via new `qwen-extension.json`
- Amp: `amp skill add aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills` — works out-of-box
- Kimi Code CLI: `kimi plugin install <github-url>` — works out-of-box
- CodeBuddy: `/plugin marketplace add <repo>` then `/plugin install aaron-seo-geo` (in-app 2-step) — via new `.codebuddy-plugin/marketplace.json`

#### Zero-.py design philosophy (enforced)

v9.0.0 removes **all Python scripts** from the repo to enforce AGENTS.md's "content-only repository" claim. The two previous dev utilities are now slash commands:

- `scripts/sync-versions.py` → deleted; replaced by [`/seo:sync-versions`](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/commands/sync-versions.md) maintenance command (pure-markdown; includes a jq one-liner fallback for CI)
- `scripts/validate-descriptions.py` → deleted; replaced by [`/seo:validate-library`](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/commands/validate-library.md) maintenance command
- `scripts/validate-skill.sh` retained (bash, pre-existing, ClawHub spec validator)

Contribution rule added to [CLAUDE.md](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/CLAUDE.md): new developer utilities go as `commands/*.md` slash commands, not `.py` scripts.

#### Infrastructure

- `cloudmetrics.io` (real domain, tort risk) replaced with `acme-analytics.example` (RFC 2606 reserved) in examples
- `hooks.json` dangling reference fixed (`examples.md §Archive Block Format`)
- PRIVACY.md accuracy rewrite (default no-transmit + WebFetch + MCP explicit)
- PostToolUse hook session-level debounce (content-quality nag suppression)
- Wiki init threshold lowered (5 → 3 non-stub files)
- Artifact Gate structural requirements now checked via path + frontmatter rather than prose grep

#### Validators (all green)

- validate-skill.sh per-directory: 20/20 pass, 0 warnings
- validate-skill.sh --status: 20/20 version-consistent across `version:` and `metadata.version:`
- `/seo:validate-library` (replaces validate-descriptions.py): 20/20 pass
- JSON parse (plugin, marketplace, .mcp.json, hooks.json, gemini-extension, qwen-extension, .codebuddy-plugin/marketplace): 7/7 OK
- 622 GitHub absolute URLs verified resolvable
- 160/160 required skill sections present
- Six-way SHA256 alignment verified across inlined Runbook §1-5

### v8.0.0 — Unified Version Release (2026-04-15)

Unifies all 20 skill versions to 8.0.0. Consolidates v7.0.0 (Wiki Knowledge Layer) and v7.1.0 (Auditor Runbook Inline Strategy) into a single coherent release with all skills at the same version.

**Includes all v7.0.0 and v7.1.0 changes**:
- Wiki Knowledge Layer with auto-refreshed structured index, project isolation, and `/seo:wiki-lint`
- Auditor Runbook with Critical Fail Cap enforcement (veto items cap at 60/100)
- Guardrail Negatives (windowed positive reframes for years, numbers, qualifiers)
- User-Facing Translation Layer (no internal jargon in audit output)
- `/seo:contract-lint` command for drift detection
- `/seo:p2-review` command for deferred item evaluation
- Auditor-class handoff extension fields (`cap_applied`, `raw_overall_score`, `final_overall_score`)
- New reference files: auditor-runbook.md, AUDITOR-AUTHORS.md, contract-fail-caps.md, ADR convention

---

### v7.1.0 — Auditor Runbook Inline Strategy (2026-04-11)

**Target**: protocol-layer auditors (`content-quality-auditor`, `domain-authority-auditor`).

**Heads-up for existing users**: if you audited a page under v7.0.0 and re-audit it now, your score may drop — for example from 82 to 60 — even though you didn't change the page. This is not a regression. It's the new rule catching something the old rule missed. When it happens, **scroll to the "Critical Issue to Fix" section of your audit report**. One item there (usually a missing disclosure, a misleading title, or data that contradicts itself) is capping your score. Fix that one item and the score returns to its natural level.

**What changed**:
- **Critical Fail Cap now enforced numerically**: when any veto item fails (CORE-EEAT T04/C01/R10, CITE T03/T05/T09), the affected dimension and overall score are capped at **60/100**. 2+ veto fails return `status: BLOCKED` instead of a score. Previously, veto fails only "capped at Low" with no numeric ceiling, producing misleadingly high scores.
- **Auditor Runbook** introduced at `references/auditor-runbook.md` as single source of truth for handoff schema, cap arithmetic (decision table + 3 worked examples), Guardrail Negatives (windowed positive reframes), Artifact Gate self-check, User-Facing Translation Layer, BLOCKED-path escape hatch, and cross-version rerun explainer. Sections §1-5 are inlined into both auditor SKILL.md files with dual sha256 sync markers (`source_sha256` + `block_sha256`) for drift detection.
- **Guardrail Negatives**: years in `[current_year − 2, current_year]`, numbered lists, qualifiers, short acronyms, and correct homepage/inner-page title patterns are treated as positive signals. Auditors no longer flag "2026" as stale when authored in 2026. Pages bearing an older year (e.g., "2020" in 2026) still get flagged for R-dimension review.
- **User-Facing Translation** (Runbook §5): veto item IDs, raw-vs-capped numeric deltas, and internal field names (`cap_applied`, `raw_overall_score`, `final_overall_score`) are forbidden in user-visible output. Translated to plain language. A rerun-after-upgrade detection prepends a one-line explainer when the score changed only because the rule changed.
- **Handoff extension fields** (`cap_applied`, `raw_overall_score`, `final_overall_score`) added for auditor-class skills. Non-auditor skills unaffected. Consumer skills treat these fields as optional with documented defaults during the v7.1.0 → v7.2.0 deprecation window. An extra `class: auditor` frontmatter field marks protocol-layer gates for `/seo:contract-lint` discovery.
- **CLAUDE.md 350-line rule** formally exempted for auditor-class skills to accommodate the inlined Runbook (~700 line ceiling).

**New reference files**:
- [references/auditor-runbook.md](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/references/auditor-runbook.md) — authoritative Runbook
- [references/AUDITOR-AUTHORS.md](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/references/AUDITOR-AUTHORS.md) — onboarding guide for new auditor-class skill authors
- [references/decisions/README.md](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/references/decisions/README.md) — Architecture Decision Record convention
- [references/decisions/2026-04-adr-001-inline-auditor-runbook.md](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/references/decisions/2026-04-adr-001-inline-auditor-runbook.md) — rationale for this release
- `memory/hot-cache.md` seeded with an Auditor Runbook index line
- `memory/audits/` directory initialized for downstream P2 trigger evaluation

**Modified reference files**:
- [references/skill-contract.md](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/references/skill-contract.md) — added Auditor-class Extension clause to Handoff Summary Format
- [references/core-eeat-benchmark.md](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/references/core-eeat-benchmark.md) — veto section links to Runbook §2 for cap arithmetic, no numbers restated
- [references/cite-domain-rating.md](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/references/cite-domain-rating.md) — same treatment for T03/T05/T09

**Shipped alongside v7.1.0**: `/seo:contract-lint` drift detection command (dual-hash validation: `source_sha256` + `block_sha256`), `/seo:p2-review` command for July 2026 tombstone evaluation, `references/contract-fail-caps.md` cap numbers SSOT, PostToolUse hook for external Artifact Gate validation (with silent-skip for non-audit Writes).

**Deferred to v7.3.0**: multi-veto numeric cap calibration (requires 30+ real multi-veto audits in `memory/audits/`), Gap Typology field, Failure Modes Catalog. All subject to P2 observation triggers evaluated 2026-07-10 by `/seo:p2-review`.

**Rejected during review**: Blind Pass / Coverage Gap (Claude cannot genuinely ignore in-context frameworks), Evidence Layering ceremony (no consumer), Python-based deterministic layer (violates Tier 1 zero-dependency). See ADR-001 for full rejection rationale.

Reviewed across three rounds by 15 agent perspectives: Round 1 (Skeptic / UX Advocate / Impl Verifier / Prompt Engineer / Sustainability), Round 2 (Continuity Checker / Red Team / DevEx / Migration / Doc Quality), Round 3 (Impl Auditor / Integration Tester / Drift Preventer / Regression Checker / Release Readiness). The final implementation incorporates all 14 Round 3 findings including the 2 BLOCKERs (README.md sync, `class: auditor` discovery) and the 5 HIGH fixes (arithmetic integrity, hook silent-skip, cross-version rerun rule, archive format, dual-hash drift detection).

### v7.0.0 — Wiki Knowledge Layer + Infrastructure Upgrades (2026-04-06)

Major release: wiki compilation layer for cross-skill knowledge synthesis, plus infrastructure and community upgrades accumulated since v6.0.0. Inspired by [Karpathy's LLM Wiki pattern](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f).

**Wiki Knowledge Layer** ([full spec](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/references/proposal-wiki-layer-v3.md)):
- **Structured index**: `memory/wiki/index.md` — auto-refreshed compiled index of all WARM files with precise fields (score, 健康度, status, next_action, mtime) and best-effort summaries
- **Project isolation**: `memory/wiki/<project>/index.md` partitioned by hot-cache `project` field; single-project users unaffected
- **Auto-refresh**: PostToolUse silently updates index after WARM writes; first init requires manual trigger (`refresh wiki index`)
- **User-tier guidance**: SessionStart provides natural-language next-step guidance for light users; structured dashboards for power users
- **Compiled pages** (Phase 2): entity/keyword/topic pages with SHA-256 source hash tracking and confidence-labeled contradiction reconciliation (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- **`/seo:wiki-lint` command** (10th command): 7-check health scan — contradictions, orphan pages, stale claims, missing pages, cross-references, HOT drift, hash mismatches
- **WARM retirement dry-run** (Phase 3): `wiki-lint --retire-preview` lists candidates; actual archival requires user confirmation
- **Terminal architecture**: HOT/WIKI/COLD three-layer target via gradual WARM absorption
- **Safe rollback**: `rm -rf memory/wiki/` reverts to pre-wiki behavior with zero side effects
- **Response Presentation Norms**: conclusion-first, natural language, collapsible technical detail, no internal jargon in user-facing output
- **Optional Wiki Hints**: handoff summary fields (Wiki Entities, Wiki Keywords) for cross-skill metadata

**Infrastructure (from v6.1.0–v6.2.0)**:
- `when_to_use` and `argument-hint` frontmatter fields added to all 20 skills
- Hooks hardening: SessionStart matcher narrowed; Stop split into focused prompts; FileChanged monitors hot-cache overflow; UserPromptSubmit connector tier awareness
- Memory system: dual truncation rule (80 lines + 25KB), staleness protocol, frontmatter standard
- Community governance: SECURITY.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, CITATION.cff, PRIVACY.md, .github/FUNDING.yml, issue templates
- README redesign: hero tagline, badges, 6-language switcher, collapsible skill finder
- 5 localized READMEs: Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Portuguese

### v5.0.0 (2026-03-29)

Unified operating model: shared skill contract, prompt-based hook automation, three-tier temperature memory, protocol-layer gates, state write-through, trigger widening, and published-link hardening.

**Unified skill contract (Plan C)**:
- Added shared [skill contract](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/references/skill-contract.md) and [state model](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/references/state-model.md) reference documents
- Updated all 20 SKILL.md files with `When This Must Trigger`, `Quick Start`, `Skill Contract`, and `Next Best Skill` sections
- Replaced bulky per-file 20-skill navigation blocks with a compact system-mode header

**Hook lifecycle (Plan C+)**:
- Added 4-event prompt-based hooks in hooks/hooks.json (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, PostToolUse, Stop)
